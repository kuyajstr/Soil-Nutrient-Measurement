This repository contain a portion of the code for the undergraduate thesis, entitled "Soil Nutrient Monitoring with Fertilizer Recommendation"

The developed prototype provides a soil monitoring feature using soil sensors over a local network. The measurement and analysis are to be performed by a microcomputer to monitor soil parameters and recommend fertilizer to achieve optimal soil condition for crop growth.

This code however, only contain the measurement of the soil parameter over the MQTT protocol.
